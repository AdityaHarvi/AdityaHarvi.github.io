As part of the UI programming team on Nightingale, we essentially re-wrote the entire backend for the UI systems in the game to ensure they would be maintainable for the live service model that the studio is striving for. My greatest accomplishment to date is being the owner of the game's Big-Data UI system capable of loading, filtering, and sorting thousands of entries/data-assets at once. I've also taken lead on any localization issues/features we would require for the game (like fallback features for auto-scrolling text).
